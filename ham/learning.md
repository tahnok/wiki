 #Ham Radio (WIP)



Here are some resources about ham radio you might be useful. Gonna be focused on Canada.
Practice Apps

I found it quite useful to practice the exams over and over again. These are the 2 apps I used on android.

 - [Canadian Amateur Radio Quiz: weird layouts but has both basic and advanced quiz questions.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gcard.amat)
 - Ham Radio Canadian Basic Test: first one I used and works ok.

Study Guides

There are lots of books out there on ham radio, but few of them are focused on Canada. Below is the "official" study guide. It was moderately useful as a reference, but very hard to read through. Worth while in combination with the above quiz apps to see what the correct answer should be and why.

Note: the website to order is _really_ old school, but I didn't get my credit card stolen so...

The Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) has some official resources, but I can't speak for their usefulness
